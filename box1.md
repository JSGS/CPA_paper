###Box 1: Using GitHub in the Briefing Note Process
As our explanation of GitHub may illustrate, using and understanding GitHub faces a very steep learning curve (Lawson 2013; Longo 2014). Readers of this journal may find the application of GitHub to the concept of a briefing note helpful in understanding how GitHub might be used in public administration practice for document-based collaboration. Consider a briefing note template for a government department existing as a GitHub repo. A policy analyst asked to create a new briefing note would ‘fork the repo’ and start to write a new briefing note based on the copy of the template now in the new ‘fork’. Both files now exist, with the system tracking their relationship (the new briefing note as a fork of the original template) and precisely logging all of the subsequent activity — including changes made by the policy analyst, contributions from her colleagues collaborating on the new briefing note and comments and approvals from superiors. If recommended changes to the original template are sent back to the original owner as a ‘pull request’, these can be accepted and incorporated into the template or be used to create a new template (or, indeed, rejected). If the new note is repurposed in the future, a new fork of that fork will be created; any previous work that built on the template will be attributed to the policy analyst and new work attributed to subsequent users, with the original template remaining intact. The relationships among the documents are automatically tracked, as is the work of the person responsible for contributing their content. Forking an existing template or note does not require permission of the owner (though there is a capacity for ‘private repos’ in GitHub to closely control who has access to certain files and folders), but an owner must approve changes (i.e., ‘merge the pull request’) to a previous document. In such a system, a user can build on previous work, the relationship among documents is tracked and work effort and responsibility is captured in the system back-end.
